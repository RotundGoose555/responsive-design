            <h3>This page walks you through the steps of redesigning a website using the course pathways page from Brown University's Computer Science Department as an example. I chose this website because it's one I interact with often and often find it takes me a while to get the information I need.

          After self-assesing I also ran the website through  <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank"> WebAIM WAIVE</a> an online tool that scans and detects accessibility problems of a given website.
          Unsurprisingly WebAIM didnâ€™t find many accessibility concerns: the page is (besides the navigation bar and footer) entirely text based. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This strength of the previous iteration of the website is something to keep in mind while redesigning. The aim is to address the memorability and efficiency concerns <b>without</b> compromising the website's accessibility.
