        <h3 class="sketch-description">In developing user interfaces it's helpful for designers to put themselves in the shoes of those using the interface. This website walks through the process using CVS self-checkout machines as a case study. I've outlined the interface components below.  </h3>

          <div class="sketch-functionality">
              <h6 class="white-title">What's What</h6>
              <ol class="sketch-list" type="1">
                <li>This is the virtual receipt that updates as users scan items </li>
                <li>This is the item counter, that updates each time a user scans an item successfully</li>
                <li>This is the static image that instructs the user on how to use the interface</li>
                <li>This button is for users enrolled in  CVS’s rewards program to look up their account by telephone number</li>
                <li>This button switches the interfaces language to spanish</li>
                <li>This button alerts the interface that the user is using their own bags, pressing this stops the weighted sensor from raising an error</li>
                <li>This button alerts the cashier via light and noise that the user needs assistance</li>
                <li>This button is pressed when the user wants to finish their self checkout and pay for their bagged items</li>
                <li>This is a speaker that provides feedback and instruction to the user throughout the self checkout process</li>  
                <li>This is the separate interface that users use to pay for their bagged items</li>
                <li>This is the bagging area that houses a scale used to verify the users scanned item</li>
                <li>This is the scanner that the user uses to scan the barcode of their items </li> 
              </ol>
          </div>
      </div>

      <div class="observations">
        <h4 class="observations-text"> Observing the interface I noticed that users tended to be students and they seemed to have more trouble the more items they had. The scale seemed pretty finnicky and twice while watching people had to wait for an attendant. The process also seemed to take longer than the cash register. Often the cash register was left unmanned, but sometimes there would be no line for both and people would still opt for the self checkout. </h4></div>
      </div>

      <div class="questions">
        <h5 class="black-title">With these observations in mind I came up with five questions to ask users:</h5>
        <div class="questions-table">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th> Questions </th>
              <th> Person 1 </th>
              <th> Person 2 </th>
              <th> Person 3 </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>What brought you to CVS today?</td>
              <td>Cups and Mixers</td>
              <td>A snack and energy drink before going to the gym</td>
              <td>Stocking up on supplies and snacks for their dorm</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>How many items did you purchase?</td>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>12</td>
              <td>15</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Why did you choose this particular store?</td>
              <td>It’s close to their dorm</td>
              <td>It’s on the way from class to the gym</td>
              <td>It’s close to their dorm/don’t have access to a car</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Why did you opt to use self checkout?</td>
              <td>There was a line for the register</td>
              <td>It was quicker than going to the register</td>
              <td>They don’t know - they always use the self checkout</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="question-column">How was your experience using the self checkout?</td1>
              <td>Had trouble getting some items to scan, but good besides.</td>
              <td>Quick and uneventful</td>
              <td>Not good, the self checkout kept getting mad because it thought they weren’t scanning everything, and had to get help multiple times. </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="observations">
        <h4 class="observations-text"> After interviewing users, two clear subsets of customers emerged; the laidback shopper and the rushed shopper. Almost everyone I observed in the store used the self-checkout, likely for its percieved speed of use. Ironically those who appeared more rushed tended to have more issues with the interface, so those with less time took longer. To represent this, using an amalgamation of user responses I created two different personas; Rushed Ronald and Savvy Sammy. </h4></div>
      </div>

      <div class="personas">
        <h5 class="black-title">Personas:</h5>
        <div class ="horizontal-flex">
          <img class="persona-img" src="Persona 1.png" alt="Persona of Ronald, a shopper who has a bad experience ">
          <img class="persona-img" src="Persona 2.png" alt="Persona of Linda, a shopper who has a good experience ">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="storyboard">
        <h6 class="white-title" > I then used these personas to create one storyboard about the self-checkout experience at CVS:</h6>
        <img class = "storyboard-img" src="storyboard1.png" alt="Story board of Ronald a stressed college student who remembers he needs pencils. While in CVS he picks up other items he needs. He opts to use the self checkout but in his rush starts to put items in his bag instead of the scale." >
        <img class = "storyboard-img" src="storyboard2.png" alt="Continued storyboard, the bagging error causes the system to lockout, Ronald is angry, he waits for a cashier to come let him back in. He then proceeds with his checkout making sure to bag each item. He then disappears quickly into the night leaving behind his receipt. Ronald is not even more stressed and angry than before. ">
